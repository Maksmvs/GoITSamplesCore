Iterables

Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. 
They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from. 
All these objects have an iter() method which is used to get an iterator.

Iterators

An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.
Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the 
iterator protocol, which consists of the methods __iter__() and __next__().

Generators
Generators give you lazy evaluation. You use them by iterating over them, either explicitly 
with 'for' or implicitly by passing it to any function or construct that iterates. 
You can think of generators as returning multiple items, as if they return a list, 
but instead of returning them all at once they return them one-by-one, 
and the generator function is paused until the next item is requested.
